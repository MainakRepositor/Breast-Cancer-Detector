### Problem : 

Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped create advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to detect whether a person has Breast Cancer by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
